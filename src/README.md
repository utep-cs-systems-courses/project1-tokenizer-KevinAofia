Lab Project 1: Building a tokenizer

# Summary of lab:

Using the skills we have learned we will practice by:

      - using command line tools (cp,mv,mkdir,cd,emacs,make,git and other need
      commands) in program development under bash.

      - Developing and debugging C programs that include, pointer arithmetic, dynamic
      memory allocation as well as using malloc/calloc/free.

      - create mulitple source files (headers with declarations), and working
      with linked lists data structures inC.

      - Designing a comprehensive small program in C language.

NOTES:Always include the header file that declares something in the C file
that defines it. This makes sure that the declaration and definition are always in-sync.
