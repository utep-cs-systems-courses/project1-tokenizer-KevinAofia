# Lab Project 1: Building a tokenizer

# Overview:

Using the skills we have learned we will practice by:
  - using command line tools (cp,mv,mkdir,cd,emacs,make,git and other need
  commands) in program development under bash.
  - Developing and debugging C programs that include, pointer arithmetic,
  dynamic memory allocation as well as using malloc/calloc/free.
  - create mulitple source files (headers with declarations), and working with
  linked lists data structures in C.
  - Designing a comprehensive small program in C language.

NOTES:Always include the header file that declares something in the C file
that defines it. This makes sure that the declaration and definition are always in-sync.
